## Abstract

High entropy superalloys are promising class of material with unique properties, but their development and optimization remain ongoing. This study focuses on Fe-based high entropy superalloys and their stacking fault energy (SFE), a critical parameter influencing deformation mechanism and creep resistance. This development is economically cheaper since itâ€™s utilizing Fe element rather than Ni element which has been widely developed. Leveraging machine learning and computational thermodynamics, we propose a novel approach for predicting SFE using big data analysis. The simulation is carried out by determining the parameter used for thermodynamic calculation. These parameters are used to calculate SFE value by utilizing MATLAB software. The results of these calculation become the database for machine learning model. The model is built using TensorFlow especially using the Deep learning Neural Network (DNN) architecture. The model predicts the numerical values of SFE as well as their classes. Our research establishes an optimal design guide for achieving desired SFE values at 300 K: Ni (20-25 at%), Cr (15-36 at%), Al (5-20 at%), Cu (9-20 at%), and Fe (20-35 at%). Employing a deep learning neural network model, we achieve an impressive 0.008 Root Mean Squared Error in predicting SFE values and class. This work contributes to advancing high entropy superalloy design, providing valuable insights into their mechanical behavior, and enabling improved creep resistance for demanding applications.
